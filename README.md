# MLH-Local-Hack-Day :computer:
Local Hack Day: Build is a week-long celebration of building hacks both big and small. Each day, you’ll receive challenges to complete. The more challenges you conquer, the more points you’ll earn. Tune in each day to check out the leaderboard and show off all that you’ve built. You pick which challenges to accept, so whether this is your first time coding or you’re a seasoned expert, Build has something for you.
